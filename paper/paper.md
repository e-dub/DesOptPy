# Summary
DesOptPy (DESign OPTimization in PYthon) was designed a Python-based tool for design optimization, especially of lightweight structures and mechancial systems. This package integrates optimization algorithms from pyOpt and pyGMO, with expansion to others being possible. This allows for complex handling of large-scale optimization problems typical of structural design optimization. The goal of this project is to design a versatile and general optimization toolbox for design optimization in which the setup of an optimization problem is easily, quickly, efficiently and effectively, allowing colleagues and students to dive into optimization problems without difficulty. It is also meant to be modular and easily expanded. Though developed for design optimization of mechanical structures, DesOptPy has been written to be flexible and, therefore, optimization problems of other disciplines can be applied.


# Statement of need

`DesOptPy: DESign OPTimization in PYthon` 


# Mathematics

Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\pi/x}$

Double dollars make self-standing equations:

$$\Theta(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
0\textrm{ if } x < 0\cr
1\textrm{ else}
\end{array}\right.$$

You can also use plain \LaTeX for equations
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fourier}
\hat f(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{i\omega x} dx
\end{equation}
and refer to \autoref{eq:fourier} from text.

# Citations

Citations to entries in paper.bib should be in
[rMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
format.

If you want to cite a software repository URL (e.g. something on GitHub without a preferred
citation) then you can do it with the example BibTeX entry below for @fidgit.

For a quick reference, the following citation commands can be used:
- `@author:2001`  ->  "Author et al. (2001)"
- `[@author:2001]` -> "(Author et al., 2001)"
- `[@author1:2001; @author2:2001]` -> "(Author1 et al., 2001; Author2 et al., 2002)"

# Figures

Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% }
